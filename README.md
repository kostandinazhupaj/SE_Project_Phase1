# Additional Notes
The technologies we use may change in the future when we start our project officially.

# Chosen Development Model
The chosen development model for the expense tracking app is Waterfall due to its systematic and sequential methodology. With the project's scope clearly defined and its needs largely set in stone, Waterfall offers a clear development structure. This model fits very well with the project's simple nature because it enables a methodical progression through phases including requirements analysis and definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing and operation and maintenance. Waterfall is a suitable option for the development of this project since it also streamlines project management due to the little necessity for client interaction beyond the requirements phase. Additionally, it can offer a precise structure for allocating resources, enabling effective use of funds and staff throughout the course of development.

# Application Specifications
## a. Architecture:
Client-Server Architecture: This architecture is well-suited for web-based applications like Finance Tracker, where users interact with the application through web browsers and data is processed and stored on the server. 
Client Side: 
User Interface (UI): The client side consists of the user interface, which is typically a web browser where users interact with the application.
Client-Side Logic: This includes client-side scripts or applications responsible for handling user inputs, making requests to the server, and presenting data received from the server to the user.

Server Side:
Application Server: The application server hosts the business logic and processes user requests. It's responsible for handling client requests, executing application logic, and generating responses.
Database Server: This component hosts the database where all the application's data, including user information, financial transactions, and settings, are stored.
Communication Protocol:

HTTP/HTTPS: The communication between the client and the server typically occurs over the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Client requests are sent to the server, and the server responds with the requested data or performs necessary actions.

Interactions:
User Interactions: Users interact with the client-side UI to perform tasks such as logging in, adding expenses, setting budgets, and generating reports.
Client-Server Communication: When a user performs an action on the client-side UI (e.g., adding an expense), the client sends an HTTP request to the server with relevant data. The server processes the request, updates the database if necessary, and sends a response back to the client.

Data Storage and Retrieval:
The server interacts with the database server to store and retrieve data. For example, when a user adds an expense, the server stores the expense details in the database. When generating reports, the server retrieves relevant data from the database and sends it to the client for display.

## b. Database Model:

Tables:
a. tblusers:
id (Primary Key, INT): Unique identifier for each user.
name (VARCHAR): User's name.
email (VARCHAR): User's email address.
mobile_number (VARCHAR): User's mobile number.
password (VARCHAR): User's password.
reg_date (DATETIME): Date and time when the user registered, with a default value of the current timestamp.

b. tblexpenses:
id (Primary Key, INT): Unique identifier for each expense entry.
user_id (Foreign Key, INT): References the id column in the tblusers table.
expense_date (DATE): Date of the expense.
expense_item (VARCHAR): Description of the expense item.
cost (VARCHAR): Cost of the expense.
note_date (DATETIME): Date and time when the expense was noted, with a default value of the current timestamp.

Relationships:
a. One-to-Many Relationship:
Each user in the tblusers table can have multiple expense entries in the tblexpenses table.
This is represented by the foreign key user_id in the tblexpenses table, which references the id column in the tblusers table.

Constraints:
Primary Key Constraint:
Both tables have a primary key constraint defined on their respective id columns, ensuring uniqueness for each record.
Foreign Key Constraint:
The tblexpenses table has a foreign key constraint on the user_id column, referencing the id column in the tblusers table. This ensures referential integrity, meaning that every expense entry must be associated with a valid user.

## c. Technologies Used:
PHP:The main server-side programming language chosen for creating the backend functionality of the expense tracking application is PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor). Because of its , widespread usage, and compatibility with MySQL, it's a great option for developing dynamic web applications. Because of PHP's adaptability, it can be seamlessly integrated with external  databases to provide efficient information processing and manipulation.

MySQL: MySQL is used to store and administer the app's data An expense tracking program needs to be able to handle a great deal of transactional data, and this is something that its efficiency, adaptability, and reliability allow it to do. MySQL's PHP compatibility streamlines database interactions, making it easier for developers to access data quickly.

JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Layout and styling are handled by CSS, and user experience and interaction are improved with JavaScript. When combined, they make it possible to create a user interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and responsive, guaranteeing a smooth surfing experience on a variety of screens and devices.

Framework: Frontend frameworks such as Angular or React can be used selectively to improve the user experience and speed up UI development

Modeling-Dajana & Kostandina
Use Case Diagram: 
A use case diagram shows the different ways people (or other systems) can use your application. It's like a map of all the different things your application can do. For example, a use case diagram for a music streaming app might show that users can search for songs, create playlists, and listen to music. 


Activity Diagrams: 
Activity diagrams show the flow of activities in your application. They're like flowcharts that show the steps involved in completing a task. For example, an activity diagram for booking a flight might show the steps involved, like searching for flights, selecting one, and entering passenger information. 

State Diagrams: 
State diagrams show the different states that an object in your application can be in, and how it transitions between those states. They're like maps of all the possible "statuses" your application can be in. For example, a state diagram for a light switch might show that the switch can be in the "on" or "off" state, and how it transitions between them.
